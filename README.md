# django-watchlist  
Website I made using Django in order to learn some html and css.  
Idea: keep track of everything you watch(TV series, movies, anime etc.) in one place.  
Deployed on heroku:  
https://my-wl.herokuapp.com/  
The website was made for Google Chrome. Some CSS styles may not work on other browsers.  
If you want to test the website use this testing account:
